# Multi-Class-Classifier-using-Neural-Networks
A generic neural network architecture to learn a model for multi-class classification. It consists of implementing back propagation algorithm from the first principles to train the network. It uses  mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent and mean squared error (MSE) as loss function. The activation function used is sigmoid.

The dataset used here is Fashion MNIST dataset. The dataset consists of 28 × 28 gray-scale images belonging to Zalando’s 10 article classes. The first 784 columns of the data correspond to the pixel values. The last column is the target label. The neural network predicts the class for each image.
